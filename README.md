This repo is a collection of ops challenges from Code Fellows. 

The fundamental concepts I've learned from doing Ops 201 ops challenges was the integratation of variables, functions, and loops in bash and powershell scripting. 

My favorite assignment was ops challenge 12 where we had to copy command ouputs to a text file. I can see myself using this command and automating many computer processes. 

These examples of shell scripting can easily be applied to the workplace. This includes: automating the code compiling process, running a program or creating a program environment, manipulating files, linking existing programs together, executing routing backups, and monitoring a system. 

I would like to continue improving ops challenge 11; automating Windows system configurations on my own PC in particular.
